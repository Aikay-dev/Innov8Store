Generally use gitBash
NOTE: Before you push, first pull from main. Also push to that your own branch 
git pull origin main ...used to update your version of the code on github
git pull origin dev ...used to pull from a brance called dev
git push origin main ...used to push your code to the main

git branch osora ...creating my own branch named osora
git branch -a ...to check the branches
git checkout osora ...to cd into a branch with the name osora
git add Apx.jsx

!!!pull requests are used to ask the adim to pull your code that you've pushed into your branch to the main
!!!to see other peoples branches you have to pull them e.g git pull origin pinky
